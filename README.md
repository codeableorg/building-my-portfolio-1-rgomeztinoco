# Building my portfolio 1

We have been working on a standard personal website using Codeableâ€™s design
system. It is time for you to build your own website. Choose your colors,
typographies, shapes, and more.

Your task is to build the following pages:

## Home

The Home page should include summary information about you, your articles, and
your portfolio.

## Articles (and 1 page for each article)

The Articles page should include the list of all your articles (for now it could
be only one that is repeated a lot of times). You should have a page for at
least 1 article. Write it! Choose a topic and write something about it. It could
be about technology or whichever topic you are interested in.

## Portfolio (and 1 page for each project)

The Portfolio page should list a summary of all your projects. Create a details
page for at least 1 project. Sell it as a product! Make it interesting, list the
main features and the technologies (or technical concepts) behind it.

## About

Share a few things about yourself. Start with a little summary, list your
technical and soft skills, share your hobbies and passions.

### Technical requirements

- Organize your CSS in multiple files
- Use BEM to name your classes
- Make your components adaptive to different screen sizes
- Use semantic HTML elements (header, footer, nav, section, article, etc.)
- Use CSS variables to define your colors
- Use Flexbox and Grid when necessary
- Use a navbar to link all your pages

You can use our standard website as inspiration but remember to make it your
own.
