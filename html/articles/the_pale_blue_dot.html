            I'm a dot, inside of a dot, inside of a dot, inside of a dot... We all are just that.
            Mi name is Ricardo i'm from Perú and this is me.<br>I think a lot, and recently I have realized that if I never write all these things, 
            it is very likely that they will stay in just that, thoughts.<br>I invite you to finish this blog, although considering everything that exist on the 
            internet, it is indeed just that. A dot.<br><br>A few years ago, I came across this picture. It was taken by the Voyager 1 spacecraft in 1990. 
            It is the farthest image we have of the earth. At this distance, the earth is just a dot. <br>Do you get to see it? No, it is not dust on your screen. It's the Earth. 
            That tiny dot of 0.12px in size. That's here, it's our home, it's us. <br>By now, you must be wondering what is this blog about? 
            What's the point of all this? But bear with me, everything has a reason.<br>This image puts into perspective everything we are. 
            It makes me feel so insignificant and at the same time so special. 
            How can something so small stand out in that photo? 
            Because everything else is practically black, and the earth is that single dot 
            that shines in the void of infinity. I think it is that duality of sensations that 
            it causes me, that makes it so special to me.<br><br>To paraphrase Sagan. Think about all the people who have been here before us from the 
            beginning of the human species, all their problems, all their feelings, all their wounds, 
            all their mistakes and successes; have occurred in that little pale blue dot.<br>It makes me think about how alone we are in the universe, which is sad to think about, 
            but also a wake-up call. No one is going to save us from ourselves. 
            For now, we only have this tiny little piece of the universe.<br>This is where I wanted to get, this is me. A dot within this pale blue dot. 
            At the beginning, I told you that I don't want everything I think to remain only thoughts. 
            That's because I care about this dot.

            Today, it is inconceivable to me to deny that we as a species are destroying ourselves, 
            and we are destroying our home, the earth. But I also think that we as a species are extraordinary, 
            and we have the potential to do amazing things, like take that photo. <br>Well, that's what I'm here for, so we can change and keep the only home we've had so far. 
            To achieve this, we must reinvent ourselves once again as a species and achieve changes at all 
            levels of our lives. This is the space where I will write about anything that I believe that 
            could do a positive change. And this is me just trying.<br><br><br>If you liked the image and what it means to me, I invite you to watch this <a href="https://youtu.be/xYmDyHC4Oc0" target="_blank">video</a>, in which Carl Sagan explains it to you much better than I did.
